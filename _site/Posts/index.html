1111Nowadays, cybercrime is one of the most relevant and critical threats to both the economy and society in Europe. Establishing efficient and effective ways to protect services and infrastructures from ever-evolving cyber threats is crucial for sustaining business integrity and reputation as well as protecting personal and sensitive data.
To that end, the SHIELD project proposes a universal solution for dynamically establishing and deploying virtual security infrastructures into ISP and corporate networks. SHIELD builds on the huge momentum of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), as currently standardised by ETSI, in order to virtualise security appliances into virtual Network Security Functions (vNSFs), to be instantiated within the network infrastructure using NFV technologies and concepts, effectively monitoring and filtering network traffic in a distributed manner.
